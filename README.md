# Project SVD and Its Application
## Introduction
This project is to implement Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and apply it to image compression and collaborative filtering.

**Keep it simple**: Since mathematic is just the art of assigning different names to the same concept. SVD is nothing more than decomposing vectors onto orthogonal axex-- we just decided it may need a more deluxe name.
## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
- cv2

Otherwise, you can use colab.google to run the code.
## Installation
```bash
pip install Numpy
pip install Matplotlib
pip install Scipy
pip install opencv-Python
```
### Regarding knowledge
-It is required that you have a basic knowledge of linear algebra, vectors, matrices, inverse matrices, eigenvalues, eigen vectors, unit length, properties of matrices, especially square matrices.

if you are not familiar with these concepts, you can refer to the following link: [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
or you can refer to the following link: [eigenvalue_eigenvector_unit_length](eigenvalue_eigenvector_unitlength.pdf)

-It is also required that you have a basic knowledge of Python programming language, a little bit of image processing and  machine learning.


## Decomposing a Vector into two orthogonal axes
 In this section, we will decompose a vector into two orthogonal axes. The vector is a 2D vector, and the axes are also 2D. The axes are orthogonal to each other.
 To clarify this issue further, you can folow this link: [Decomposing a Vector into two orthogonal axes](Decomposing_a_Vector_into_two_orthorgonal_axes.pdf)

## Express the operation of vector decomposition using matric (SVD)
 We have clarified the concept of decomposing a vector into two orthogonal axes. Next, we will not only apply this concept to a vector but also to a matrix. [Express the operation of vector decomposition using matric (SVD)](Express_the_operation_of_vector_decomposition_using_matric_(SVD).pdf)
