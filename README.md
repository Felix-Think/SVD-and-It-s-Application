# Project SVD and Its Application
## Introduction
This project is to implement Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and apply it to image compression and collaborative filtering.

**Keep it simple**: Since mathematic is just the art of assigning different names to the same concept. SVD is nothing more than decomposing vectors onto orthogonal axex-- we justdecided it may need a more deluxe name.

## Decomposing a Vector into two orthogonal axes
 In this section, we will decompose a vector into two orthogonal axes. The vector is a 2D vector, and the axes are also 2D. The axes are orthogonal to each other.
 To clarify this issue further, you can folow this link: [Decomposing a Vector into two orthogonal axes](Decomposing_a_Vector_into_two_orthogonal_axes.pdf)

## Express the operation of vector decomposition using matric (SVD)
 We have clarified the concept of decomposing a vector into two orthogonal axes. Next, we will not only apply this concept to a vector but also to a matrix. [Express the operation of vector decomposition using matric (SVD)](Express_the_operation_of_vector_decomposition_using_matric_(SVD).pdf)
